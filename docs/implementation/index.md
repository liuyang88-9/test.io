# Implementing DDD Architecture

After understanding the [Strategic Design](/strategic-design/) principles and [Tactical Design](/tactical-design/) patterns of Domain-Driven Design, the next step is to apply these concepts in real-world applications. This section covers architectural patterns and implementation approaches for DDD.

## Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Practice

Domain-Driven Design is not tied to any specific technology or architectural style. However, certain architectural patterns complement DDD principles particularly well by:

- Separating domain logic from infrastructure concerns
- Protecting the domain model from external influences
- Supporting the evolution of the model over time
- Enabling testing of business logic in isolation

## Key Implementation Architectures

### Layered Architecture

[Layered Architecture](/implementation/layered-architecture) is a traditional approach for organizing domain-centric applications, typically with presentation, application, domain, and infrastructure layers. It provides a clear separation of concerns but can become rigid as the application grows.

### Onion Architecture

[Onion Architecture](/implementation/onion-architecture) (also known as Ports and Adapters or Hexagonal Architecture in some variants) inverts dependencies to ensure that the domain model remains at the core, with all dependencies pointing inward. This approach provides stronger isolation for the domain.

### Hexagonal Architecture

[Hexagonal Architecture](/implementation/hexagonal-architecture) focuses on separating the application's core from external concerns through ports (interfaces) and adapters (implementations). It allows the core business logic to remain agnostic of UI, database, and other external systems.

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

[CQRS](/implementation/cqrs) separates read and write operations into different models, allowing each to be optimized for its specific task. This pattern can significantly improve performance and scalability, particularly in complex domains with different read and write requirements.

### Event Sourcing

[Event Sourcing](/implementation/event-sourcing) stores the state changes of an application as a sequence of events rather than just the current state. This approach provides a complete audit trail, powerful temporal queries, and natural integration with event-driven architectures.

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing DDD, you'll need to make decisions about:

- **Programming Language**: Some languages better support DDD concepts (e.g., strong typing, immutability)
- **Data Storage**: Traditional RDBMS, document databases, event stores, or polyglot persistence
- **Communication Patterns**: Synchronous calls, asynchronous messaging, event-driven design
- **UI Architecture**: How UI concerns interact with the domain model
- **Integration Strategy**: How bounded contexts communicate with each other

## Example Project Structure

A typical DDD project structure might look like:

```
src/
├── ModuleName/ (typically a Bounded Context)
│   ├── Application/ (application services, commands, queries)
│   │   ├── Commands/
│   │   ├── Queries/
│   │   └── EventHandlers/
│   ├── Domain/ (core domain model)
│   │   ├── Models/
│   │   │   ├── Entities/
│   │   │   ├── ValueObjects/
│   │   │   └── Aggregates/
│   │   ├── Events/
│   │   ├── Repositories/ (interfaces)
│   │   └── Services/
│   └── Infrastructure/ (technical implementations)
│       ├── Persistence/
│       ├── ExternalServices/
│       └── Messaging/
```

## From Tactical Patterns to Implementation

The implementation of DDD tactical patterns will vary based on your chosen architecture:

| Pattern | Layered | Onion/Hexagonal | CQRS | Event Sourcing |
|---------|---------|----------------|------|----------------|
| Entities | Domain layer | Core | Write model | Event-sourced entities |
| Value Objects | Domain layer | Core | Both models | Immutable values |
| Aggregates | Domain layer | Core | Write model | Event streams |
| Repositories | Interface in domain, impl in infrastructure | Ports in core, adapters outside | Write side | Event store + projections |
| Domain Events | Domain layer | Core | Integration between models | Core concept |
| Services | Domain or application layer | Core or outside | Command handlers & query services | Command handlers |

## Best Practices for DDD Implementation

- **Start with bounded contexts**: Clearly define your model boundaries
- **Invest in the core domain**: Focus implementation efforts where business value is highest
- **Use ubiquitous language**: Make your code speak the language of the domain
- **Protect the domain model**: Don't let infrastructure concerns leak into domain logic
- **Embrace iterative refinement**: Expect your model to evolve as domain understanding deepens
- **Consider Microservices alignment**: Bounded contexts can serve as boundaries for microservices
- **Don't over-engineer**: Apply the appropriate level of DDD for your context
- **Focus on business needs**: Technical elegance is secondary to solving business problems

## Common Implementation Challenges

- **Persistence complexity**: Mapping rich domain models to storage systems
- **Transaction boundaries**: Ensuring consistency across aggregate boundaries
- **Performance concerns**: Balancing rich models with performance requirements
- **Learning curve**: Getting teams comfortable with DDD thinking and patterns
- **Legacy integration**: Applying DDD in brownfield applications
