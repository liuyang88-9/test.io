# Strategic Design in DDD

Strategic Domain-Driven Design focuses on the big picture of the system. It deals with large models and high-level concepts, helping teams understand the problem domain and establish clear boundaries for complex systems.

## What is Strategic Design?

Strategic Design is the part of Domain-Driven Design that helps you:

- Define the **overall structure** of the system
- Establish **boundaries** between different parts of the system
- Foster **collaboration** between technical and domain experts
- Create a **shared language** for discussing the domain
- Identify the **core domain** to focus efforts where they provide the most value

## Key Concepts in Strategic Design

### Bounded Contexts

[Bounded Contexts](/strategic-design/bounded-contexts) are explicit boundaries within which a domain model applies. They provide a way to divide a large system into smaller, more manageable parts with clear interfaces between them.

### Context Mapping

[Context Mapping](/strategic-design/context-mapping) is about understanding the relationships between different bounded contexts and explicitly defining how they interact.

### Ubiquitous Language

[Ubiquitous Language](/strategic-design/ubiquitous-language) is a shared language between domain experts and technical teams, used consistently in code, documentation, and conversation within a bounded context.

### Domain Storytelling

[Domain Storytelling](/strategic-design/domain-storytelling) is a collaborative approach to understanding and communicating about domain knowledge by creating visual stories with domain experts.

## Benefits of Strategic Design

- **Reduces complexity** by breaking down large systems into manageable chunks
- **Clarifies team boundaries** and responsibilities
- **Improves communication** between business and technical stakeholders
- **Focuses investment** on the most valuable parts of the system
- **Provides guidance** for tactical design decisions

Strategic design is the foundation for successful Domain-Driven Design implementation. It helps teams build a shared understanding of the problem space before diving into the solution space.
