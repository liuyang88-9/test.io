# Domain-Driven Design Architecture

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts to create a conceptual model that addresses complex business domains.

<InteractiveDDDDiagram />

## Why Domain-Driven Design?

- **Tackle complex domains** by focusing on the core domain and domain logic
- **Create a common language** between developers and domain experts
- **Form boundaries** between different parts of the system
- **Build flexible, modular, and maintainable** software architecture
- **Focus on business value** rather than technical implementation details

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Domain-Driven Design in your software projects, from strategic and tactical patterns to concrete implementation approaches.
